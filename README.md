# Spotify API and Playlist
I wanted to learn more about APIs so I played around with Spotifyâ€™s API. I decided to explore a playlist of mine because there was a sequence to adding a specific song to the playlist. The playlist has only 25 songs but I want to see how the audio features of the songs changed throughout the playlist.

This is the Tableau data visualization that I created after getting the data from Spotify's API. You can view the visualization on my [Tableau Public profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aloysius.ong/viz/playlist_16552129990400/Dashboard1).

I wanted the data visualization to feel like a journey. A journey through each song. A different journey when analyzing different audio features.
